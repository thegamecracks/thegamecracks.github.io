Test Post
=========

Hey, this here is a post presented by `ablog`_. I don't plan to post anything
right now, but it looks neat!

.. _ablog: https://ablog.readthedocs.io/

I accidentally found this extension while browsing through `sphinx-book-theme`_'s
documentation. I would've just wrote posts like my other two guides,
but this seemed like a nicer way to present them.

Yesterday was also the first time I found out about sphinx-book-theme
while scrolling through `sphinx-themes.org`_, and I thought it looked quite
familiar to the `Furo`_ theme I previously used for my `discord-ws`_
and `joblin`_ packages, but this seemed more pleasant for reading.
You can tell I haven't looked at `matplotlib`_ or `pandas`_'s documentation
often enough to recognize the similarities. ðŸ™ƒ
